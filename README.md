# ‚úàÔ∏è ExitFlight: E-Ticket Generator & Booking Simulator

**ExitFlight is a modern, full-stack (frontend-focused) application built with Next.js 15, designed to simulate the core functionalities of a flight booking system.** It guides users from selecting flights and inputting passenger details to viewing a dynamically generated e-ticket preview.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of building a web application that incorporates a range of modern technologies, including the Next.js App Router, Server & Client Components, advanced client-side data simulation, and a sleek, responsive UI.

## üì∏ Project Showcase

_(This is the most important section! A common practice is to create a `.github/assets` folder in your repository to store and reference your screenshots.)_

**1. Flight Selection & Simulation**
<br> _A dynamic form where users can select airports, dates, and airlines. The app calculates realistic flight times and distances on the fly._

**2. Multi-Step Passenger Details Form**
<br> _A clean, validated form using React Hook Form and Zod for capturing passenger information._

**3. Generated E-Ticket Preview**
<br> _A final, polished preview of the mock boarding pass with all simulated details._

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **‚úàÔ∏è Dynamic Flight Simulation:**
  - Select origin and destination from a comprehensive list of major world airports.
  - The application dynamically calculates estimated flight details using **geographical coordinates** and timezone data.
  - Generates realistic flight durations, local departure/arrival times, and timezone differences using `date-fns` and `date-fns-tz`.

- **üñ•Ô∏è Modern UI/UX with Next.js 15:**
  - Built on the **Next.js App Router**, leveraging both Server Components for static content and Client Components for interactivity.
  - Clean, responsive, and intuitive UI built with **React 19**.
  - Leverages a custom component library built with **Shadcn/UI** and styled with **Tailwind CSS v4**.
  - A multi-step progress stepper guides users smoothly through the booking flow.

- **üìù Robust Form Handling:**
  - Multi-step forms managed with **React Hook Form**.
  - End-to-end type-safe validation using **Zod** schemas.
  - State is managed across the user journey with **React Context**.
  - Form details persist across browser sessions via `localStorage` for an improved user experience.

- **‚öôÔ∏è Component-Based Architecture:**
  - Highly modular and reusable components organized for clarity and maintainability.
  - Utilizes **Geist** for clean, modern typography and **Lucide React** for icons.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

This project is a solid foundation. Future development could include:

- **Backend API:** Implement a backend using Next.js Route Handlers to manage data.
- **Database Integration:** Connect to a database like PostgreSQL using an ORM (e.g., Drizzle, Prisma) to persist bookings.
- **Dynamic PDF Generation:** Use a library like `pdfkit` on the server to generate downloadable PDF e-tickets.
- **Email Confirmations:** Integrate an email service (e.g., Nodemailer, Resend) to send booking confirmations with the PDF attached.
- **User Accounts:** Add authentication to allow users to save and view their booking history.
